# python-discord-bot

Install:
Since you’re learning how to make a Discord bot with Python, you’ll be using discord.py.

discord.py is a Python library that exhaustively implements Discord’s APIs in an efficient and Pythonic way. This includes utilizing Python’s implementation of Async IO.

Begin by installing discord.py with pip:

$ pip install -U discord.py
Now that you’ve installed discord.py, you’ll use it to create your first connection to Discord!

```
pip install -U discord.py

pip install -U python-dotenv
```

Create a `.env`:

```
# .env
DISCORD_TOKEN={your-bot-token}
```
